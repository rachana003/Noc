## Network on Chip (NOC) Design Solution README
## Problem Statement:

 The challenge involves crafting an optimized Network on Chip (NOC) within a System on Chip (SoC) framework. This NOC facilitates seamless data exchange between a CPU, an IO peripheral, and System memory through a weighted arbiter. The goal is to achieve optimal area and power efficiency while meeting stringent performance criteria, including latency and bandwidth. Variability in traffic patterns, driven by CPU and IO workloads, further complicates the design process.

## Solution Overview:

 Our solution addresses the NOC design challenge through a Python-based simulation approach. Key aspects of our solution include:

#### Simulation Script:
 We provide a Python script, noc_simulation.py, to simulate NOC behavior and evaluate performance metrics.
#### Buffer Management: 
Placeholder functions are included for setting maximum buffer sizes to optimize data transfer latency.
#### Arbiter Weight Configuration:
 Placeholder functions allow for setting predetermined arbitration weights for CPU and IO agents.
#### NOC Design Adjustment:
 Placeholder function enables adjustment of NOC design parameters based on performance metrics.

## Usage:
#### Clone Repository:
 Clone this repository to your local machine.
#### Run Simulation Script:
 Execute the Python script noc_simulation.py to simulate NOC behavior and evaluate performance metrics.
#### Review Results: 
Check the console output for average latency and bandwidth metrics. Ensure they meet the specified requirements.
#### Adjust NOC Parameters (Optional):
 If performance metrics fall short, utilize the provided placeholder functions to fine-tune NOC design parameters.
## Requirements:
##### Python 3.x
##### Random module (included in Python standard library)
